# Product Guidelines: ZenPulse

## Visual Identity
*   **Primary Aesthetic:** **Minimalist & Clean**. The app should feel light and airy, utilizing significant white space, soft shadows, and subtle gradients to evoke a sense of calm.
*   **Premium "Expensive" Feel (Paywall):** Leverage **Glassmorphism & Blur**. Use translucent layers and background blurs over high-quality, high-resolution imagery to create a sophisticated, high-end experience that encourages conversion.
*   **Typography & Shapes:** Use soft, rounded corners for all UI elements. Prioritize legible, clean sans-serif fonts.

## Design Systems & Patterns
*   **Core System:** **Material Design**. Adhere to Material Design principles (Google's design system) for layout, component behavior, and interaction patterns to ensure a versatile and familiar experience for Android users, while maintaining accessibility and clean hierarchy.
*   **Mobile Specifics:** Ensure all layouts respect **SafeArea** (avoiding notches and home indicators). All touch targets must be at least 48x48 pixels for high "clickable" confidence.

## Content & Interaction
*   **Tone of Voice:** **Zen & Serene**. All text, especially AI-generated affirmations and session descriptions, should be soft, encouraging, and slightly poetic. Avoid harsh or overly technical language.
*   **AI "Magic" Feedback:** When generating content, provide a **subtle typing animation**. This visual cue simulates a "live" generation process, making the AI's response feel more personal and immediate.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Speed to Zen:** The path from opening the app to starting a meditation or seeing an affirmation should be as short as possible.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** Use size and weight to clearly differentiate between "Free" and "Premium" content without being intrusive.
