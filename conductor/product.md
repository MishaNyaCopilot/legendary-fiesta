# Product Guide: ZenPulse

## Vision
ZenPulse is an AI-powered meditation application designed primarily for high-stress professionals seeking quick, accessible, and personalized stress relief. The core value proposition is to deliver immediate impact through AI-generated content and a streamlined mobile experience.

## Target Audience
*   **Primary:** High-stress professionals looking for quick, effective breaks during their day.
*   **Secondary:** General users interested in exploring mindfulness through a modern, tech-forward interface.

## Core Features (MVP)
1.  **Smart Paywall (Subscription Logic):**
    *   Visually engaging design in a "meditation style".
    *   Clear presentation of Premium benefits.
    *   Two pricing tiers: Monthly and Yearly (with a "Best Value" highlight).
    *   "Try for Free" action that simulates a successful purchase and unlocks content.

2.  **Meditation Hub (Main Screen):**
    *   A curated list of meditation sessions displayed as cards with imagery and duration.
    *   **Locking Mechanism:** Content is restricted based on subscription status. Non-subscribers see "greyed out" or locked cards that redirect to the Paywall.

3.  **"AI Vibe" & Daily Affirmations:**
    *   Interactive mood selection using emojis (e.g., 3 state options).
    *   **AI Generation:** On-demand generation of a short affirmation or meditation text based on the selected mood (simulated or real LLM call).

## User Journey
1.  **Onboarding/Paywall:** User opens the app and is presented with the Premium value proposition.
2.  **Conversion:** User selects a plan or tries for free, unlocking the full experience.
3.  **Discovery:** User browses the list of available sessions.
4.  **Engagement:** User selects their current mood to receive a personalized AI-generated affirmation.
